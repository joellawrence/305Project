# 305Project
## Edmonton Property Assessment Application

The objective of this assignment was to develop a Java application using JavaFX to learn object-oriented programming components and popular design patterns.

The work was split into teams in the final weeks of the course, where my team and I worked collaboratively on another teammate's files.

*Note: This project did not actively use Git, but was shared on GitHub nearing the end of semester to share with classmates for collaboration, hence the one and only commit 'Inital commit'.*
